# MorseCat

MorseCat is an ESP-32 (MicroPython) based Morse code keyer and player. Petting MorseCat using the appropriate Morse symbols and timings will illicit a response in kind with lights and sound. Because it's able to connect to the internet, you can even get cat facts from the CatFacts API out of it, thanks to an attached OLED screen. 

**Please note**, the below video contains flashing lights
